  Maika Klaukien: artistic director and choreographer.
  November 2017 
  
  Theme: Resilience, realized through an artistic exploration of the rhythm of flow, waves which generate impact and forward motion followed by response, undertow and return. I draw on the German translation of the word Resilience for inspiration, namely, Elastizität - Elasticity.  
  
  The work is held together by an explosive power and strength, harnessed to ceaseless motion. The theme speaks to life itself, a way to live in our time. Every action is met by an equal and opposite reaction. Each event generates an even stronger backlash. Turns in unexpected and different directions cascade and ricochet, pulled and pushed by random elasticity. All around is surprise, unpredictability, shock. 
  
  Resilience is living with the waves and riding them. 
  
  And, as the undertow, we hear the words of Shakespeare, living still, alive tonight, in this, St Leonard’s, his church.  Redolent with humanity, wrought in matchless prose, we live the interplay between power and the vulnerable, the eternal, yoked dance of the weak and the strong. 
  
  The aim of the event is to evoke emotions, provoke thought and encourage the audience to immerse itself in the creative elasticity of the inexorable ebb and flow of their own lives in the present and in the performance space. 
   
  St Leonard’s church in Shoreditch is the core of this collaborative project, a site-specific performance and a fundraising event for the charity Foundation for Change based in the Church. 
  
  The project is inspired by the approach of the charity, the ethos of the Church, the history of the East End and by the spirit of our times. St Leonard’s, its features and architecture, its history and tradition is deeply rooted in the area. This protective and welcoming space serves as a starting point for the project and will be an integral part of the performance.
  
  Inspired in this way artists will work together to realize the ambition of this urgent, contemporary theme. They include composer Michael Haslam, Director of Music at St. James Church, Piccadilly, Trimmer, saxophonist, lighting designer Jonathan Samuels, Oana Stanciu (projection artist), Osca Whiting (designer) and eight performers brought together by Maika Klaukien, the artistic director and choreographer.
  
  Foundation for Change
  
  Foundation for Change (FfC) is a registered charity that exists to bring about social change through education. The founders, Bob Bharij and Liz Naylor, have worked together since 2005 and set up FfC in 2014. They now have a small team of staff and volunteers based in St Leonard’s church. The aim of FfC is to provide a sophisticated response to the complexity of disadvantage, tackling social exclusion and enabling people who have experienced significant difficulties with drugs or alcohol to participate in society. 
  
  Through their programmes, they help those they work with to consciously choose how they want to live, be it in relation to being a better parent, family member or partner, volunteering, or gaining employment and achieving financial independence. The majority of their courses are accompanied by accredited qualifications and include the option of volunteer placements which significantly boost the chances of achieving employment, thereby helping to break the often inter-generational cycles of substance misuse and support social participation. 
  
  FfC bring a creative and much needed new approach to tackling disadvantage. Summer 2017 saw the first of a Big Lottery funded intake of their new Feminism for Change course – a female only programme that introduced key concepts of feminist theory through which participants were supported to view their lives. Autumn 2017 saw the launch of Clothing for Change (CfC) led by Bex Exell, a graduate of two of FfC’s courses. A trained tailor, Bex is selling her designs online under the Clothing for Change label, the income generated going towards the CfC project itself. This will be a six-month intensive course in tailoring where individuals will learn to design, sew and create tailored pieces of clothing. It will also include a detailed introduction to setting up their own tailoring business for individuals who want to work towards self-employment.  	
  
  St Leonard’s Church
  
  Dedicated to St Leonard, the patron saint of prisoners and those who are mentally ill, there has been a church on the present site for many centuries. It was this church which became the actors’ church. The first English theatre was close by in New Inn Yard where several of Shakespeare’s plays had their initial performance. Many of the Elizabethan theatrical fraternity are buried in the medieval church under our crypt. This includes three Burbages, James who built the first English theatre, his son Cuthbert who built the Globe theatre and his other son Richard who was the first to play Macbeth, Hamlet, Richard 3rd, Othello and especially Romeo. So the first Romeo is buried in the crypt where Shakespeare placed the final scene of his tragic play.
  
  St Leonard’s Church, also known as Shoreditch Church, has always been committed to its community, particularly those who live on the streets that often have difficulties with drugs and/or alcohol. The church built Acorn House, an 18 bed alcohol rehabilitation centre that is run by the Spitalfields Crypt Trust (SCT). 
  
  FfC work in partnership with SCT, specifically the New Hanbury Project, delivering a 10 week introduction to psychology course to compliment the vocational courses they offer to those in recovery. Volunteers from the New Hanbury Project have re-landscaped the church gardens and tend to it daily, creating a wonderful haven away from the bustling Shoreditch High Street. The church grounds also include an allotment where volunteers in recovery from drug/alcohol dependency grow vegetables that are eaten in Acorn House.

      Kreislauf, which translates as "circulation" in German, was performed in 
      January 2019 at The Cockpit Theatre, Marleybone. It was inspired by the human heart, 
      exploring ideas around strength through unity versus individuality, 
      human connection and compatibility, and group support.
